If aliens ever came to visit earth, we can explain our entire history of our species through a binge session of all episodes of OnePiece. Anime is life."

			"title": "Tibetian Throat Singing",
			"description": "I love Tibet. I love singing. I love throats (in fact I collect them as another hobby). Mixing them all together gets you Tibetan throat singing. It is such a beautiful art, no matter how terrible I am at it. Even if my neighbors try to bomb my bedroom and my parents have disowned me from the noise, I continue to follow my passion."

			"description": "Everybody loves money. Money makes the world go round. Money can also be round. Earth is really old. Finding really old coins is nice. They may not be shiny, but not all shiny things are great like the grease in my classmate’s hair."
