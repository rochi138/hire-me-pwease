# Source code for [Hire Me Pwease, the Internet's Only Terrible Resume Generator](https://rochi138.github.io/hire-me-pwease)

What if you could fill out a few simple questions and have the perfect resume that reflects your half-assed attitude?

Website to take in information from a user through a form and generates a resume with the provided information. All information missing will be filled in with random content (ex. 19 years of experience in breathing). The site allows the user to download the resume as a pdf... with the download button in it.

Created for Terrible Hacks XII.

## Acts as a personal repo of many features including:
* procedurally generating components
* form generation
* PDF download
* JSON storage
* YouTube player
* fontawesome icons
* dark mode (and others!)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
